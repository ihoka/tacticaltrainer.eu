Recovery isn't just rest—it's an active process that determines how well you adapt to training stress. For tactical athletes, proper recovery protocols can mean the difference between peak performance and burnout.

## The Recovery Hierarchy

Not all recovery methods are equal. Here's the hierarchy of importance:

### 1. Sleep (Non-Negotiable)

Sleep is the foundation of recovery. Without adequate sleep, everything else is compromised.

**Targets:**
- 7-9 hours per night
- Consistent sleep/wake times
- Cool, dark sleeping environment

### 2. Nutrition

Post-workout nutrition drives adaptation:

- **Protein**: 0.25-0.4g per kg bodyweight within 2 hours post-training
- **Carbohydrates**: Replenish glycogen, especially after HIC sessions
- **Hydration**: Replace what you lost, plus extra

### 3. Active Recovery

Low-intensity movement on rest days:

- 20-30 minute walk or easy bike
- Mobility work and stretching
- Swimming or light hiking

### 4. Stress Management

Chronic stress impairs recovery:

- Breathing exercises
- Time in nature
- Social connection

## Weekly Recovery Template

Here's how to structure your week for optimal recovery:

| Day | Training | Recovery Focus |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| Mon | Strength | Sleep prioritization |
| Tue | HIC | Post-workout nutrition |
| Wed | Active Recovery | Mobility, walking |
| Thu | Strength | Sleep prioritization |
| Fri | LISS | Light intensity only |
| Sat | HIC or Rest | Based on weekly load |
| Sun | Full Rest | Social, outdoors |

## Signs You Need More Recovery

Watch for these red flags:

- Declining performance despite consistent training
- Elevated resting heart rate
- Poor sleep quality despite fatigue
- Mood changes or irritability
- Nagging minor injuries

## The Bottom Line

You can't out-train poor recovery. Invest as much thought into your recovery protocols as you do your training, and you'll see better results with less risk of injury.

**Remember**: Adaptation happens during recovery, not during training.
