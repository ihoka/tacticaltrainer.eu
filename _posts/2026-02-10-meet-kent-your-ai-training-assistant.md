It's Tuesday night. You're in week 5 of Operator, and your squats felt unusually heavy today. You're scrolling through Reddit, searching old forum threads, asking in the TB Facebook group: "Should I deload early? Drop the weight? Push through?"

You get three conflicting answers, none from people who know your training history, your maxes, or what you did last week.

That's the gap we built Kent to fill.

## The Missing Piece

Tactical Trainer gave you world-class programming—proven templates, calculated percentages, structured periodization. The plans work. But even the best program doesn't answer questions at 0500 when you're deciding today's workout, doesn't adjust when you miss a session, doesn't explain the why behind the methodology when you're second-guessing the plan.

Kent is your AI training assistant built into Tactical Trainer. A Tactical Barbell methodology specialist available 24/7. Not a generic chatbot—a tactical training expert who knows your profile, your plan, and your progress.

Think of Kent as the force multiplier you've been missing: the knowledgeable teammate who's there when you need guidance, without the forum delay or conflicting advice.

## What Kent Does

Kent does what the best training partners do: answers your questions, adjusts when life happens, and keeps you on track—without the group chat delay or second-guessing.

### Instant Answers to Training Questions

No more mental math at 0530. Ask Kent what's on the schedule, and he reads your plan and gives you the full session with calculated weights.

"What's today's workout?" → Complete session with percentages converted to actual pounds.

"What weight for squats?" → Kent knows your training max and today's prescription.

### Smart Plan Adjustments

Life happened and you missed Monday? Kent helps you adapt the week without derailing your progression.

Want to swap deadlift for front squat mid-cycle? Kent recalculates your remaining weeks with the new lift and suggests appropriate training maxes.

Feeling crushed after three weeks of heavy training? Kent can suggest adjustments based on your completion history and recovery patterns.

### Programming Guidance

Should you run Base Building or jump to Operator? Kent knows your experience level, your goals, and the methodology—he'll guide you to the right template.

Kent explains the why behind TB programming when you ask. Why wave loading? Why these specific percentages? Why the conditioning split matters?

And Kent enforces the fundamentals. Beginners can't skip Base Building. New lifters won't get advanced protocols they're not ready for.

### Workout Logging Through Conversation

"Done with squats, hit all sets at 275" → Kent logs it.

No forms to fill out. No clicking through menus. Just tell Kent what you did, and he tracks your progress naturally.

## Kent in Action

Here's what working with Kent actually looks like:

### Quick Daily Check

```
You: What's today's workout?

Kent: Strength session. Week 4, Day 2.
• Squat: 3x3 @ 275 lbs (85% of 325 TM)
• Bench: 3x3 @ 225 lbs (85% of 265 TM)
• Weighted Pull-Up: 3x3 @ 45 lbs (85% of 53 TM)
```

### Mid-Cycle Adjustment

```
You: I missed Monday's session. What should I do?

Kent: Run Monday's workout today, push Wednesday to Thursday.
Your week becomes: Today (Mon workout), Thu (Wed workout), Sat (Fri workout).
Keeps you on progression. Want me to adjust the calendar?
```

### Programming Decision

```
You: Should I run another Operator block or switch to something else?

Kent: You've completed two Operator blocks. Strength is solid.
How's your conditioning? If HIC times haven't improved much,
consider a Black cycle—6 weeks conditioning-focused with strength maintenance.
Then return to Operator with fresh legs.
```

Notice Kent's voice—direct, no fluff, answer first. He's built to communicate like a seasoned operator, not a corporate chatbot.

## Who Kent Is For

Kent works for everyone on Tactical Barbell, regardless of experience level:

- **New to Tactical Barbell** - Kent guides you through the methodology without forum-diving or waiting for coach replies
- **Experienced operators** - Quick answers when you know exactly what you need
- **Time-constrained athletes** - No waiting for forum replies or scheduled coach availability
- **Anyone juggling training with real life** - Kent adapts when schedules shift and plans need adjustment

## What Makes Kent Reliable

Kent isn't just a chatbot with TB books loaded in. He's built with guardrails and methodology expertise:

**Won't give medical advice.** Injury questions get redirected to medical professionals. Kent can help modify your program to work around cleared limitations, but he won't diagnose or treat.

**Enforces fundamentals.** Beginners can't skip Base Building. Kent won't recommend unsafe mid-cycle changes or training max increases beyond tested maxes.

**Knows your context.** Kent reads your profile, training history, and current plan before answering. His advice is personalized to your situation, not generic.

**Pushes back once, then respects your decision.** If you suggest something questionable, Kent warns you and explains why. But ultimately, he respects that you're in command of your training.

**Admits uncertainty.** When you ask about something TB doesn't specifically address, Kent says so: "TB doesn't specifically address this, but based on the principles..." Honest about methodology limits.

This isn't AI slapped onto a training app for marketing points. Kent is built on the same proven agent framework that powers the plan generation system—tested, refined, and focused on getting you results.
