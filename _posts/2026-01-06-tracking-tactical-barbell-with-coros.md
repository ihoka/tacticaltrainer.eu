Running a Tactical Barbell program requires balancing multiple training modalities—strength sessions, conditioning work, and active recovery. After years of tracking workouts in spreadsheets and apps that didn't quite fit the TB methodology, I've found that the Coros ecosystem provides the metrics and flexibility that actually matter for tactical athletes.

Here's how I use the Coros Pace Pro watch and Training Hub to track and optimize my Tactical Barbell training.

## Why Coros for Tactical Barbell?

Tactical Barbell isn't your typical bodybuilding split or marathon training plan. It combines:

- **Strength training** (Max Strength, Strength Endurance clusters)
- **High Intensity Conditioning** (HIC sessions)
- **Low Intensity Steady State** (LISS/E sessions)

Most fitness trackers are optimized for either runners OR lifters—not both. Coros handles the hybrid nature of TB remarkably well, tracking everything from barbell work to trail runs under one unified training load model.

## The Coros Training Hub: Your Command Center

The Training Hub is where the magic happens. It's a web-based platform that aggregates all your data and provides insights that go beyond what you see on the watch.

### Key Metrics I Monitor

**Base Fitness Score**
This number represents your overall training foundation—the cumulative fitness you've built over time. For TB athletes, watching this climb during a Base Building block is incredibly motivating. I aim to keep this steadily increasing during Continuation phases.

**Load Impact**
This shows the acute training stress from recent sessions. During an Operator template week with 3 strength sessions and 2-3 conditioning workouts, I typically see Load Impact numbers between 14-25. If it spikes too high, I know I need to dial back intensity or add recovery.

**Intensity Trend**
This percentage indicates whether you're training harder or easier than your baseline. During a peak week or when testing maxes, seeing this climb above 100% is expected. But if it stays elevated for weeks, overtraining risk increases.

## Tracking Strength Sessions

For Max Strength days (squats, bench, weighted pull-ups, deadlifts), I use the Strength activity mode on the Pace Pro. Here's my workflow:

1. **Start the activity** before my warm-up sets
2. **Log each set** using the watch buttons—it tracks rest periods automatically
3. **Record weight and reps** post-workout in the Training Hub

The watch captures heart rate data throughout the session, which feeds into the Training Load calculation. This is crucial—it means my heavy squat days are weighted appropriately against my conditioning work.

### A Typical Strength Day Logged

Looking at my recent data, a standard Operator session (SQ/BP/WPU + KB Swings at 95%) shows:

- **Duration**: ~57 minutes
- **Training Load**: 43 TL
- **Sets tracked**: 21 sets
- **Heart rate zones**: Mostly Z2-Z3 with spikes during heavy sets

## Tracking Conditioning Work

This is where Coros really shines. The platform handles both ends of the TB conditioning spectrum.

### HIC Sessions

For High Intensity Conditioning like Meat Eater or BOO (Black on Oxygen), I use either the HIIT or Cardio modes depending on the session structure.

**Example: Meat Eater II**
- 10 rounds of Russian Kettlebell Swings + Burpees
- Logged as HIIT activity
- Duration: ~24 minutes
- Training Load: 47 TL

**Example: Black on Oxygen (BOO)**
- Kettlebell Swings x 60 + 800m Run
- Duration: ~31 minutes
- Training Load: 71 TL

The Training Hub captures the intensity distribution, showing exactly how much time I spent in each heart rate zone. For HIC, I want to see significant time in Z4-Z5.

### LISS/Endurance Sessions

For Easy Runs and long steady-state work, the running modes are excellent. The Pace Pro tracks:

- Distance and pace
- Heart rate zones (should be mostly Z2 for true LISS)
- Running dynamics (cadence, stride length)
- Training Load contribution

**Example: Easy Run with Strides**
- 60-minute aerobic run + acceleration strides
- Distance: 8.79 km
- Training Load: 65 TL
- Heart rate: 97% in target zone

## The Calendar View: Seeing the Big Picture

The Training Hub calendar is where I do my weekly reviews. Each day shows:

- Activity type (icon-coded)
- Training Load score
- Brief description

This bird's-eye view helps me ensure I'm following TB programming correctly:
- Strength and conditioning properly separated
- Adequate recovery between HIC sessions
- LISS sessions staying truly low-intensity

## Weekly Training Load Analysis

On the right sidebar, the Training Hub breaks down your weekly totals by activity type:

- **Run**: Total time, distance, and TL
- **Strength**: Session time and TL
- **Trail Run**: Separate from road runs

For a typical TB Operator + Black continuation week, I target:

| Activity Type | Weekly TL Target |
|--------------|------------------|
| Strength | 60-90 TL |
| Running/Cardio | 150-250 TL |
| Total | 250-350 TL |

## Pro Tips for TB Athletes Using Coros

### 1. Create Custom Activity Types

I've set up custom activities for specific TB sessions:
- "TB Strength - Operator"
- "TB HIC - Meat Eater"
- "TB SE - Alpha Circuit"

This makes historical analysis much cleaner.

### 2. Use the Notes Field

After each workout, add notes about:
- Weights used (especially for progression tracking)
- RPE rating
- Any modifications made
- Environmental factors (heat, sleep quality, etc.)

### 3. Monitor Weekly Trends, Not Daily Numbers

A single high Training Load day isn't a problem. But trending upward week after week without planned deload periods will catch up with you.

### 4. Trust the Base Fitness Score for Long-Term Progress

TB is designed for the long game. Watching your Base Fitness score climb over months—not days—validates that the program is working.

## Integration with TB Programming

Here's how I map Coros metrics to TB concepts:

| TB Concept | Coros Metric |
|-----------|--------------|
| Volume/Intensity Balance | Training Load distribution |
| Recovery Status | Recovery Score + HRV |
| Conditioning Progress | Running fitness score |
| Overall Preparedness | Base Fitness Score |
| Overreaching Risk | Intensity Trend % |

## What the Pace Pro Gets Right

The watch itself is built for tactical athletes:

- **Battery life**: 38+ hours in full GPS mode—handles ultra-long rucks
- **Durability**: Survived mud runs, heavy rain, and gym abuse
- **Button operation**: No touchscreen fumbling with sweaty hands
- **Backlight**: Readable in any lighting condition

## Final Thoughts

The combination of Coros Pace Pro and Training Hub has become essential to how I run my Tactical Barbell programming. It's not about obsessing over numbers—it's about having objective data to validate what your body is telling you.

When the Training Hub shows elevated Intensity Trend and you're feeling run down, you have confirmation to take that deload. When your Base Fitness is climbing and PRs are falling, you know the program is working.

Track the work. Trust the process.

**Train hard. Stay ready.**
