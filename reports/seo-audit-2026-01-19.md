# SEO Audit Report: Tactical Training Blog
**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Site:** https://tacticaltrainer.eu
**Platform:** Jekyll 4.x Static Site

---

## Executive Summary

This audit identifies 12 critical SEO issues affecting the Tactical Training blog's Google Search Console performance. The most severe problems are:

1. **CRITICAL**: Sitemap contains localhost URLs instead of production URLs
2. **CRITICAL**: Canonical URLs pointing to localhost instead of production domain
3. **HIGH**: Missing post images causing broken OG/Twitter Card references
4. **HIGH**: URL mismatch between robots.txt and _config.yml
5. **MEDIUM**: Inconsistent domain references (tacticaltrainer.eu vs tacticaltraining.eu)
6. **MEDIUM**: Posts dated in the future (2026 dates)

**Impact**: These issues prevent proper indexing, cause duplicate content flags, and block social media sharing functionality.

---

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Sitemap Contains Localhost URLs

**Problem:**
The generated sitemap.xml contains `http://localhost:4000` URLs instead of production URLs.

**Location:** `/Users/ihoka/ihoka/tacticaltrainer.eu/public/blog/sitemap.xml`

**Evidence:**
```xml
<loc>http://localhost:4000/recovery/2024/12/28/recovery-protocols-for-tactical-athletes.html</loc>
<loc>http://localhost:4000/training/strength/2026/01/15/beautiful-strategy-look-at-results.html</loc>
```

**Why This Breaks GSC:**
- Google cannot index localhost URLs
- Sitemap is marked as invalid in Search Console
- All blog posts are invisible to search engines
- Zero pages can be indexed from the sitemap

**Fix Required:**
In `/Users/ihoka/ihoka/tacticaltrainer.eu/blog/_config.yml`, ensure production build uses:
```yaml
url: "https://tacticaltrainer.eu"
baseurl: "/"  # Currently set correctly
```

**Production Build Command:**
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

The sitemap plugin uses `site.url` to generate absolute URLs. If not set during build, it defaults to localhost:4000.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - This alone could block all indexing

---

### 2. Canonical URLs Point to Localhost

**Problem:**
All pages have canonical URLs pointing to `http://localhost:4000` instead of production domain.

**Evidence from rendered HTML:**
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="http://localhost:4000/training/strength/2026/01/15/beautiful-strategy-look-at-results.html" />
```

**Why This Breaks GSC:**
- Canonical tags tell Google "this is the authoritative URL"
- Google sees localhost as the canonical version
- Production pages are treated as duplicates of non-existent localhost pages
- Results in "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" errors in GSC

**Fix:**
Same as Issue #1 - build with `JEKYLL_ENV=production` and correct `site.url` configuration.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Causes duplicate content issues

---

### 3. Missing Post Images

**Problem:**
All blog posts reference images that don't exist, breaking Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata.

**Referenced Images:**
```yaml
# From posts:
image: /assets/images/max-strength.jpg
image: /assets/images/strategy-results.jpg
image: /assets/images/tactical-training-hero.jpg
image: /assets/images/default-post-image.jpg
image: /assets/images/default-og-image.jpg
```

**Actual Directory:**
```
blog/assets/images/
├── .DS_Store
└── app/
```

**Only 2 files exist** in `/app` subdirectory. All post images are missing.

**Why This Breaks SEO:**
- Broken OG:image tags fail Facebook/LinkedIn previews
- Twitter Cards don't render (no image fallback)
- Google may flag as incomplete content
- Negative user experience signal when shared
- GSC may report "Missing structured data: image" warnings

**Fix Required:**
1. Create actual images for all posts at correct paths
2. Or update all post front matter to reference existing images
3. Ensure default fallback images exist:
   - `/assets/images/default-post-image.jpg`
   - `/assets/images/default-og-image.jpg`
   - `/assets/images/logo.png` (referenced in structured data)

**Image Requirements:**
- Open Graph: 1200x630px (recommended)
- Twitter Cards: 1200x630px (summary_large_image)
- Logo: 600x60px minimum for Article schema

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks social sharing and may trigger GSC warnings

---

### 4. Domain/URL Mismatch Issues

**Problem:**
Multiple conflicting domain references throughout the site configuration.

**Configuration Issues:**

**_config.yml:**
```yaml
url: "https://tacticaltrainer.eu"  # Primary domain
baseurl: "/"
```

**robots.txt:**
```
Sitemap: https://tacticaltraining.eu/sitemap.xml  # Wrong domain!
```

**structured-data.html:**
```json
"url": "https://tacticaltraining.eu/"  # Wrong domain!
"logo": "https://tacticaltraining.eu/assets/images/logo.png"  # Wrong domain!
```

**Inconsistencies:**
- Main domain: `tacticaltrainer.eu` (correct, has CNAME)
- Referenced in structured data: `tacticaltraining.eu` (wrong)
- Referenced in robots.txt: `tacticaltraining.eu` (wrong)

**Why This Breaks SEO:**
- Robots.txt points to sitemap on wrong domain (404 error)
- Structured data references non-existent URLs
- Google can't validate Organization schema
- Mixed signals about canonical domain
- May cause "URL not found" errors in GSC

**Fix Required:**

1. **Update robots.txt:**
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://tacticaltrainer.eu/sitemap.xml
```

2. **Update structured-data.html:**
Replace all instances of `tacticaltraining.eu` with `tacticaltrainer.eu`

**Priority:** HIGH - Causes indexing and schema validation errors

---

## High-Priority Issues

### 5. Posts Dated in the Future

**Problem:**
Three blog posts have publication dates in 2026 (current date: 2026-01-19).

**Posts with future dates:**
- 2026-01-16: "Max Strength Training: High Frequency, Low Volume"
- 2026-01-15: "However Beautiful the Strategy..."
- 2026-01-06: "Tracking Tactical Barbell with COROS"

**Why This May Affect SEO:**
- Google may flag as suspicious/spammy
- Unusual publication pattern (3 posts in 2024, then 3 in 2026)
- Time-sensitive queries won't surface recent content
- "Freshness" ranking factor may not apply correctly
- Some crawlers ignore future-dated content

**Best Practice:**
- Use actual publication dates
- Maintain consistent publishing schedule
- Update `last_modified_at` for content updates instead of changing `date`

**Fix:**
Use current/past dates unless you're intentionally scheduling posts. Jekyll's future post feature requires `future: true` in config.

**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - May trigger quality signals

---

### 6. Missing Critical Images in Structured Data

**Problem:**
Organization and Article schemas reference logo and images that don't exist.

**Referenced in structured-data.html:**
```json
"logo": "https://tacticaltraining.eu/assets/images/logo.png"
```

**Article schema for every post:**
```json
"image": "{{ page.image | default: '/assets/images/default-post-image.jpg' | absolute_url }}"
```

**Impact:**
- Rich Results Test fails validation
- Articles can't appear in Google Discover
- Organization markup invalid (logo required)
- May lose eligibility for enhanced search results
- GSC reports "Invalid logo" or "Missing image" errors

**Fix:**
1. Create logo.png at specified path (600x60px minimum)
2. Create default-post-image.jpg as fallback
3. Test with Google's Rich Results Test tool

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks rich results eligibility

---

## Medium-Priority Issues

### 7. Baseurl Configuration Confusion

**Problem:**
Documentation says `baseurl: "/blog"` but actual config has `baseurl: "/"`.

**CLAUDE.md (project docs):**
```markdown
- `baseurl: "/blog"` - Site is served from /blog path
- `destination: ../public/blog` - Builds to Rails public folder
```

**_config.yml (actual):**
```yaml
baseurl: "/"  # Not /blog
destination: ../public/blog
```

**Analysis:**
- Site builds to `/public/blog` directory
- But baseurl is set to root `/`
- This means the site expects to be served from domain root
- If actually served from `/blog` path, all links will break

**Likely Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Served from subdirectory** (e.g., tacticaltrainer.eu/blog/)
- Current config breaks all links
- Need: `baseurl: "/blog"`

**Scenario B: Served from root via Rails routing**
- Current config is correct
- But sitemap URLs won't match actual paths
- Need clarity on routing setup

**Why This Matters:**
- Wrong baseurl causes 404s on all internal links
- Sitemap URLs won't match actual page locations
- Canonical URLs point to wrong paths
- GSC reports "Submitted URL not found" errors

**Fix Required:**
1. Determine actual serving path
2. If served from /blog path: change to `baseurl: "/blog"`
3. If served from root: update documentation
4. Rebuild site with correct config

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Depends on actual deployment, but could break all links

---

### 8. No Mobile Optimization Validation

**Problem:**
No evidence of mobile-first testing or validation.

**Observations:**
- CSS uses responsive breakpoints (good)
- Viewport meta tag present (good)
- BUT: No actual mobile testing documented
- No PageSpeed Insights validation
- No mobile usability checks

**Why This Matters:**
- Google uses mobile-first indexing exclusively
- GSC mobile usability issues block indexing
- Core Web Vitals affect rankings
- Tactical fitness audience likely mobile-heavy (training in gym)

**Common Mobile GSC Issues:**
- Text too small to read
- Clickable elements too close
- Content wider than screen
- Viewport not set (you have this, good)

**Fix Required:**
1. Test with Google Mobile-Friendly Test
2. Check GSC Mobile Usability report
3. Run PageSpeed Insights for Core Web Vitals
4. Test on actual mobile devices

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Essential for modern SEO

---

### 9. Thin Content on Multiple Pages

**Problem:**
Welcome post has only 240 words (3-minute read).

**Low Word Count Posts:**
- "Welcome to Tactical Training Blog": ~240 words
- About page: ~150 words

**Why This Matters:**
- Google prefers comprehensive content for informational queries
- Tactical fitness topics benefit from depth (training protocols, programming)
- Competing content likely 1500-3000 words
- Thin content signals low value to search engines

**Best Practices:**
- Minimum 800 words for informational content
- 1500+ words for competitive topics
- Depth over fluff (your longer posts are excellent)

**Good Examples from Your Site:**
- "Max Strength Training": ~1800 words (excellent)
- "However Beautiful the Strategy": ~1000 words (good)

**Fix:**
1. Expand welcome post to 800+ words (intro to tactical fitness, methodology, what makes TB different)
2. Expand about page to 500+ words (team background, credentials, philosophy)
3. Ensure future posts target 1200+ words minimum

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Affects content quality signals

---

### 10. Missing Alt Text Documentation

**Problem:**
No images currently exist, but when added, need alt text strategy.

**Current State:**
- Posts reference images in front matter
- No alt text field in front matter
- Templates don't show alt text implementation

**Why This Matters:**
- Alt text is ranking factor for image search
- Required for accessibility (legal requirement for government contractors)
- Tactical fitness has strong image search potential
- GSC flags missing alt text as accessibility issue

**Fix Required:**
When adding images, ensure:

```markdown
![Tactical athlete performing max strength squat training with barbell]({{ page.image }})
```

Or in front matter:
```yaml
image: /assets/images/max-strength.jpg
image_alt: "Tactical athlete performing back squat in training session"
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Implement before adding images

---

## Lower-Priority Optimizations

### 11. URL Structure Could Be Optimized

**Current URL Pattern:**
```
/category/category2/YYYY/MM/DD/post-slug.html
```

**Example:**
```
/training/strength/2026/01/15/beautiful-strategy-look-at-results.html
```

**Issues:**
- Duplicate category info (already in breadcrumbs/content)
- Date in URL locks content to timeframe
- Longer URLs than necessary
- .html extension (aesthetic, minor)

**Better Pattern:**
```
/post-slug/
```

**Benefits:**
- Shorter URLs (easier to share, remember)
- Evergreen content not tied to dates
- Cleaner appearance
- Focus on keyword-rich slug

**Trade-offs:**
- Changing URL structure requires 301 redirects
- Current structure not "broken" - just suboptimal
- Low priority unless redesigning site

**Fix (if desired):**
```yaml
# _config.yml
permalink: /:title/
```

**Priority:** LOW - Current structure works, just not optimal

---

### 12. Missing Search Functionality

**Problem:**
Structured data includes SearchAction but no actual search exists.

**In structured-data.html:**
```json
"potentialAction": {
  "@type": "SearchAction",
  "target": "https://tacticaltraining.eu/search?q={search_term_string}",
  "query-input": "required name=search_term_string"
}
```

**Reality:**
- No /search page exists
- No search functionality implemented
- Schema markup promises feature that doesn't exist

**Why This Matters:**
- Schema validation fails if target URL doesn't exist
- Google may penalize misleading markup
- Users can't search site content

**Fix Options:**

**Option A: Remove SearchAction**
If not implementing search, remove from structured-data.html

**Option B: Add Jekyll Search**
- Implement with Simple-Jekyll-Search plugin
- Create search.html page
- Update schema to point to actual search page

**Priority:** LOW - Remove markup or add feature, not urgent

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

**What This Changes:**
- `site.url` is respected (not overridden with localhost:4000)
- Sitemaps generate with production URLs
- Canonical tags point to production domain
- Analytics/tracking code loads
- Asset optimization enabled

**Secondary Causes:**
1. Incomplete image asset deployment
2. Domain name inconsistency (typo in structured data)
3. Configuration documentation mismatch

## Conclusion

The tactical training blog has solid foundational SEO elements (good structured data setup, proper meta tags, jekyll-seo-tag plugin), but critical deployment issues prevent Google from properly indexing and ranking the site.

The highest-impact fixes are:
1. Production build configuration (unlocks everything)
2. Creating missing images (enables social/rich results)
3. Domain consistency (fixes schema validation)

These are all straightforward fixes that don't require redesign or major content changes. Once implemented, the site should begin indexing properly within 1-2 weeks.

The quality of the content (especially the longer training posts) is excellent for SEO. Once technical issues are resolved, the blog should perform well for tactical fitness keywords.
