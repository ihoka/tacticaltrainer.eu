faq:
  - question: "What is HIC training?"
    answer: "High Intensity Conditioning (HIC) is a 10-30 minute workout protocol using 80-95% maximum effort with minimal rest, designed to build work capacity and mental toughness for tactical professionals."
  - question: "How often should I do HIC workouts?"
    answer: "Most tactical athletes benefit from 2-3 HIC sessions per week, with at least one rest day between sessions to allow for proper recovery and adaptation."
  - question: "Can beginners do HIC training?"
    answer: "Yes, HIC training can be scaled for any fitness level. Beginners should start with 2-3 rounds instead of 5 and use lighter weights or bodyweight variations."

High Intensity Conditioning (HIC) is a cornerstone of tactical fitness programming. In this post, we'll break down what HIC training is, why it matters, and how to implement it effectively.

## What is HIC?

HIC workouts are short-duration, high-intensity training sessions designed to push your anaerobic and aerobic systems simultaneously. Unlike traditional cardio, HIC creates a powerful metabolic stimulus that builds both power and endurance.

### Key Characteristics

- **Duration**: 10-30 minutes of work time
- **Intensity**: 80-95% of maximum effort
- **Recovery**: Minimal rest between movements
- **Focus**: Functional, multi-joint exercises

## Why HIC Matters for Tactical Athletes

In operational environments, you rarely have the luxury of pacing yourself. HIC training prepares you for the reality of high-stress, high-demand situations:

1. **Work capacity** - The ability to sustain effort under fatigue
2. **Recovery speed** - How quickly you bounce back between efforts
3. **Mental toughness** - Pushing through discomfort when it matters

## Sample HIC Workout: "The Grinder"

Here's an example HIC session:

```
5 Rounds for Time:
- 20 Kettlebell Swings (24kg/16kg)
- 15 Push-Ups
- 10 Box Jumps (24"/20")
- 200m Run

Target Time: 15-20 minutes
```

### Scaling Options

- **Beginner**: Reduce rounds to 3, use lighter weights
- **Intermediate**: Complete as written
- **Advanced**: Add weight or reduce target time

## Programming HIC

For optimal results, include 2-3 HIC sessions per week, balanced with strength training and aerobic base work. Never stack HIC days consecutively—recovery is when adaptation happens.

## Final Thoughts

HIC training is a tool, not the entire toolbox. Use it strategically to build the conditioning base that supports everything else you do.

**Train hard. Stay ready.**
